    "Qatar is one of the fastest growing economy and a richest GDP per capita in the world [click here for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Qatar). Qatar population constitutes a larger portion of Expat workers. \n",
    "  \n",
    "As an expat working in Qatar since 2007, I have chosen to analyse different Neighborhoods in Qatar for the benefit of the residents and mainly aimed at \"*Three Municipalities*\" as follows;\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Doha (the Capital city)\n",
    "2. Al Rayyan\n",
    "3. Wakrah\n",

    "+ Population desity and,\n",

    "**1.2 Problem**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  I have been living with my family in Qatar since 2011 and can say having first-hand experience of the living expenditures in the country. Although Qatar's expenses are comparable to the incomes it offers, it is natural for one to try and find ways to optimising the spendings within the country. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Housing and rents being one of the main sky-rocketing commodities in Qatar, should one makes the right choice, this is where the huge savings can be made conveniently. However, when you are living with family with growing up kids, aging parents or working spouses this becomes a rather difficult choice hence, the target of this Capstone to answer this particular problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For years *Doha* (Capital) has been the city of choice for families and communities, however as you will see later in this Capstone, In contrast *Doha* being the smallest municipality in Qatar (*~200Sqkm*), holding the majority of the country's population (*~40%*). \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Due to this difference resulting a heavy demand in Doha city, house rents in Capital is sky-rocketing compared to other regions of the country. However, with the recent, fast developments in Qatar mostly aiming at \"***FIFA-2022 world cup***\", the entire country's Infrastucture, Services, Highways and roads are improving at an unprecidented speed. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Therefore it is the right time for one to look for a decent neighborhood with a rich-living and easy access to all services even outside the Capital for **much less**. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Hence, I found solving this problem through my Capstone is timely and relevant to majority living in Doha."
